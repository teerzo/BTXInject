Interact Engine, Tentative name 

Current Bugs:

	Raycasting to current mesh is casting to 32k triangles
		* solution 1, replace with lower res objects
			+ more speed 
			+ faster raycast times
			- less detail? sort of 

		* Solution 2, add collision box around object as raycast target
			+ very fast raycast times
			- very inaccurate raycasting 

	Camera
		* Camera not acting as intended 
			// seems to be slightly off from expected position
		* lookAt and target don't seem to work either 

	Touch Controls
		* Movement plane being place in incorrect position to camera/object
			plane placed at 0,0,0 not at object
			Zooming breaks plane placement aswell
			objects selected offset position is incorrect
			!! Consider writing own camera controls built into engine code
				// this will fix touch/mouse event conflicts
		* Touch/Move objects, Objects jump forward towards camera 

	Surface Testing
		Chrome


	Android Testing 
		Chrome
			Selecting/highlighting Buttons/Text


	Ipad Gen? Testing 
		Very Low detail 
		Constant 57 fps idle/rotating
















Touch Controls 


Move custom object data into THREE.Object3D.userData object

Raycast to mesh
	access parent's userdata 
	set selected in parents userdata
	update via parent ( Object3D ) userdata to change colours

Interactable lights 


Move css buttons
	wrap around after each object 
	set width of the object button div ??

Movement code
	move object along axis of camera 

load rest of models
	try to load of seperated pieces of the whole model

// Object Structure 

	String name 
	THREE.Object3D Actor/Object 
	THREE.Mesh Mesh 
	Diffuse Texture
	... other Textures

	THREE.Material Material
	// bool checks
	bool selected
	bool visible 
	bool lock





Object loading working correctly
Scale with size of js file loading objects

Fps counter in 

Object selecting working as intended 
currently sets the emissive color of the material
on or off

// NEXT //

done ** Clean files  
done ** restructure paths for files and objs
not need yet **	Add min versions of THREE.js files for performance


done ** Ask someone about sam script to set my js/json file 

55 of 355 models ** Load full human body 

Load high detail multi object obj
Load high detail multi object multi obj

$$$ ** Object selection used for movement 
$$$ ** move objects when selected along axis with camera

done ** Add buttons for each obj in scene 
	Select
	Reset Position
	Hide/Show
	lock
